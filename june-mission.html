    <h1>Hello Ak Nation</h1>
</header>

<main>
    <h2>Congratulations! You have cracked the code.</h2>
    <p>This is your leader, Ak, speaking. With each passing month our nation grows stronger. Some people's faith in the cause has wavered, but those of us who have remained strong demonstrate incredible dedication and honor and must continue spreading the message. Next month, on June 5th, 2024, we will expand on our message. We will no longer simply write a note, but will include a video with the offical Ak Nation Hand Symbol as well. I look forward to your cooperation. Small we may be but dammit together we are powerful and united as Ak Nation! Slowly but surely our message will be spread across the world and we will rise above triumphantly!</p>

    <h2>Next Month's Misson</h2>
